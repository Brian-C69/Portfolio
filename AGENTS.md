# AI Agent Guidelines for portfolio

These instructions apply to all files in this repository.

---

## 1. General Principles
- Treat this repo as the source of truth for the portfolio site.
- Prefer minimal, focused changes over large refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Match the existing style, structure, and technology stack (HTML/CSS/JS or framework already in use).

## 2. Editing Rules
- Do not delete or rename files, or change public URLs/routes, unless the user clearly requests it.
- Preserve existing components and layouts; extend rather than rewrite when possible.
- Keep CSS and JS changes scoped to the relevant components/pages.
- Avoid adding new dependencies, build tools, or frameworks unless the user asks.

## 3. Code Style & Structure
- Follow the patterns already present in this repo for naming, formatting, and file organization.
- Use descriptive variable and function names (no single-letter names).
- Keep functions small and focused; avoid unnecessary abstraction.

## 4. Safety & Testing
- When possible, run or describe targeted tests/checks for the parts you modify.
- Call out any breaking changes or assumptions in your final message to the user.

## 5. Communication with the User
- Be concise and direct by default; provide more detail only when requested.
- Clearly summarize what you changed and where (file paths and key symbols).
- Suggest next steps or potential improvements, but do not implement them unless asked.
